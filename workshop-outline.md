# Workshop Outlines

## Workshop1 - Technical
### Electronics
- Cover critical electronic concepts. Voltage, current, load. Current must flow in a loop otherwise no energy can be transferred to devices.
- Open circuit, Short circuit prevention, Ohm's law
- Using a variable voltage/current power supply to prevent electronics from exploding
- Concepts regarding capacitance and inductance?
- Transistors (semi conductors)
- LEDs (forward voltage drop) 

### Actuators
- DC motor basics
- H-Bridge concepts, truth table for a typical inexpensive H-bridge (L298N)
- Solenoid?
- Hobby Servo?
- Stepper motor?

### Sensors (UI)
- Push button and Pull up / Pull down resistors
- Optical Interrupt sensors
    - Encoder
- 

### Software
- C++ (Arduino and/or PicoW) vs MicroPython(PicoW)? (Maybe we take a poll?)
    - Syntax
- Data types?
- Functions
- Template (necessary initializations aka Boiler Plate)
- 

### Algorithms / State machines / Control
- Logical flow charts
- State Machines?
- Pre-defined classes/systems (PID controller)

## Workshop2 - Prompts and Ideation
- Prior-art and research through artists list
    - Find elements in pieces from these artists that connect to ideas related to systems, positive/negative feedback, stability/instability
- Ideate through potential extensions of the "Positive Feedback Pendulum" 
- Reimagine the "Positive Feedback Pendulum's" visual asthetic. What can we do to make the concepts of instability more apparant/ more potent

## Workshop3 - Implementation and Feasibility
- Using one of your ideas from the ideation process, now ideate about how one can implement this extension or re-visualization in a feasible way
- Going through this, what are some skills/tools that you will need to execute this implementation?
-
