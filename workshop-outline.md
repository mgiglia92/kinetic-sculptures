# Workshop Outlines

## Workshop1 - Technical
### Electronics
- Cover critical electronic concepts. Voltage, current, load. Current must flow in a loop otherwise no energy can be transferred to devices.
- Open circuit, Short circuit prevention, Ohm's law
- Using a variable voltage/current power supply to prevent electronics from exploding
- Concepts regarding capacitance and inductance?
- Transistors (semi conductors)
- LEDs (forward voltage drop) 

### Actuators
- DC motor basics
- H-Bridge concepts, truth table for a typical inexpensive H-bridge (L298N)
- Solenoid?
- Hobby Servo?
- Stepper motor?

### Sensors (UI)
- Push button and Pull up / Pull down resistors
- Optical Interrupt sensors
    - Encoder
- 

### Software
- C++ (Arduino and/or PicoW) vs MicroPython(PicoW)? (Maybe we take a poll?)
    - Syntax
- Data types?
- Functions
- Template (necessary initializations aka Boiler Plate)
- 

### Algorithms / State machines / Control


## Workshop2 - Prompts and Ideation

## Workshop3 - Implementation and Feasibility
